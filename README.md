The 7th Guest Randomizer

Randomize the order that the rooms unlock in. This means you would have to check your map (at strategic times because of menu warping) and figure out routing on the fly while avoiding cutscenes. This would require knowledge of shortcuts and what triggers cutscenes.

Maybe an extra random mode could also rearrange the rooms, but that means you can't use your knowledge of the game, so to counteract that it would have to require you to visit rooms multiple times, maybe by "unsolving" puzzles randomly?
